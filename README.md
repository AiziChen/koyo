# koyo

koyo is a web application development toolkit that expands upon
Racket's built-in web-server with all the functionality that a web app
typically needs in a complete package.

All of koyo's components are decoupled so you get to pick and choose
what you use.

## Quickstart

    $ raco pkg install koyo
    $ raco koyo new example  # or raco koyo new -b minimal example
    $ cd example && cat README.md

## Documentation

The documentation is available on the [Package Server][docs].
